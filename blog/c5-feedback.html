        <h4>Pairing and Feedback</h4>
        <section>

          <p class="bodytext">At DBC, one of the main learning tools they reinforce is pair programming. Pair programming is when two people collaborate together on a problem where one person is the driver who writes the actual code and the other person is the navigator who directs and guides the driver where and what to code. This method of learning was new to me but it has definitely been effective in learning because you get to experience how someone else thinks and are able to help you see things you would not have otherwise. Not only that, we also have guided pair sessions where we have an alumnus who is available to guide both my pair and I if we get lost of confused and also give you very useful advice. Sometimes it can be frustrating working with someone who’s stubborn about doing something in a particular way but that doesn’t happen too often.  The most rewarding part of pair programming is when my and I have an “aha” moment and figure out how to solve the problem together.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Writing feedback for your pair is another thing we are required to do at DBC. The feedback we give should always be something actionable, specific, and kind.  From the pair sessions I’ve done thus far, I’ve received some very productive and useful feedback. A lot of the times, they point out things I did not even realize was helpful to them or things I should work on. Based on the feedbacks I’ve received, I think I should try to be more vocal at expressing my thought to help out my partner and also improve my indentation to make my code more easily readable.  Writing feedback to others is also fun since you get to think back to the pairing session and ask what could they have done better or what did they do really well. The most difficult part of writing feedback is when your pair is completely amazing, and I have trouble thinking of suggestions for them to improve.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Pair programming with someone to bounce ideas back and forth as well as helping you catch errors early is incredibly useful. Also we get to send feedback afterward to help each other improve on the next pairing session. Overall, I would say I’m very thankful that DBC reinforces pair programming since it’s such an effective way to learn.</p>
