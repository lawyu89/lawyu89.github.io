        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h4>2/7/15</h4>

          <p class="bodytext">This week’s cultural blog is about reflecting on our past conflicts. The last time I had a conflict was with a close friend. My friend was constantly suggesting different things I tried over a personal issue I had. Normally I wouldn’t share my personal problems with others but I also wanted to talk about with someone. My friend can be a bit presumptuous but he/she means well. I know that but at the time, for one reason or another, my friend’s advices felt more like attacks at my incompetence. It felt hurtful to me and I remember telling my friend off.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Looking back, the basic emotions I felts at the time was anger. The reason for my anger was because I was disappointed at myself and I took my anger out on my friend. I’ve always been very competitive at just about everything and I always try to be better than everyone else. Whenever I fail at something, it hurts my pride. And when friend was talking to me, it felt he/she was pointing out all my failures, which made me angry. It was wrong of me to take out my anger at my friend who was just trying to help me and I apologized to him/her after I had time to cool off.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">If I could go back, I would of tried to handle to situation differently. Instead of always trying to come out on top and holding onto false pride, I would have tried listening and been more appreciative of friend’s advice. My experience has taught me that I don’t always have to be so competitive to everyone around me. Of course this excludes videos games, I will come out on top! Well then, one more week of phase 0 and we will finally start our onsite phase 1!</p>
