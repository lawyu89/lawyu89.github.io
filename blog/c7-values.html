           <p class="bodytext">This week’s cultural blog is about reflecting on our past moments where we were most satisfied, happy, or proud and the values that come to mind. For me, when I think about these moments the values that resonate with me most are as follows (in no particular order):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accomplishments:3</li>
            <li>Challenge:4</li>
            <li>Control:4</li>
            <li>Friendships:5</li>
            <li>Helping Others:4</li>
            <li>Knowledge:4</li>
            <li>Tenacity:5</li>
            <li>Creativity:4</li>
            <li>Enthusiasm:5</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="bodytext">All of these values are important to me because they define who I am as a person. For example, tenacity is defined by “the quality or fact of being very determined”. The value resonates with me because I’m terrible at giving up. Whenever I set myself to do something, regardless of hard difficult or challenging it may be, I’ll do my absolute best to see through what I started and reach my goal. Being able to persevere through tough times has always been my strong suit.</p>

          <p class="bodytext">There’s been some people who’ve asked my for advice on technical things and sometimes wonder how I’ve managed to get to where I am technically. My response to them is simple be tenacious and enthusiastic in learning because I recall times when I was in their position feeling overwhelmed by new material. It just takes a lot of practice and patience to learn about new things like how to code in a new language. Giving advice is also fun for me because I love helping out others and creating new friendships</p>

          <p class="bodytext">Thinking back to stereotype threats, the values that are important to me are more than enough to keep me from being bogged down by it.  Obviously completing DBC’s rigorous bootcamp will require tons of effort and there may be times where I might feel down or overwhelm but in those times I’ll just think back and focus on my goal. I just need to get into my “I can do anything” mindset by thinking about all the numerous challenges I’ve overcome in my life and that this is no different. </p>
