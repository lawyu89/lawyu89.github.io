        <h1>Maintenance Headache!</h1>
        <h2>An Issue in the Tech Industry</h2>
        <h4>2/2/15</h4>

          <p class="bodytext">This week’s cultural blog we’ll be discussing about a prominent problem the tech industry faces and that is software maintenance. Software maintenance is the modification of software to improve performance, correct errors, and removing bugs. Some example of software maintenance would be something like adding features to your website, deleting useless features, or adding content to an app. According to a survey conducted by Microsoft on their employees, software engineers spend 90% of their time doing maintenance on software and only 10% actually writing new code from scratch. The reason why maintaining software is such a big issue is because most developers do not code with maintainability in mind.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">Suppose you are a developer and your boss wanted to you add some features to the companies website within a deadline and ask for rough estimate of how long it would take for you to complete the task. Unfortunately, you did not write the code and without knowing the code you cannot give an estimate. In order to better grasp what sort of program you are dealing with you would need to do some research. For starters, you can review the wiki written by the person who wrote the code but most likely it will be outdated since people often fail to record every single change made. The next option would be to actually look at the code itself and try to make sense of what does what and how everything is related but that could take a tremendous amount of times. Not to mention that you may not be able to test out your changes in fear of affecting your companies live website and losing out on potential customers.  By now you can imagine just how troublesome maintenance can be.
          </p>

          <p class="bodytext">So what can we as developers do? The answer is to write better code! There is not much we can do about existing software that were poorly written but we can alleviate stress in future by writing code that is easier to maintain. Things we can try are explicitly naming variable so it can be clearly understood what they are, leaving tons of comment on what object interacts with it, and creating as many test as reasonably possible.
