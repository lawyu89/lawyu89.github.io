      My take on the DBC experience is that it is new method of teaching students in an immersive environmental rather than the traditional school teaching methods. My impression of DBC is that its a new and exciting computer science school. I see myself having a lot of fun engaging in this type of culture as I learn much better in immersive environments. My expectation of DBC have not changed as I researched a lot on DBC before I applied. I am definitely a nervous though. I have always been somewhat of a introvert and meeting a ton of people makes me feel nervous but I think DBC will be the perfect experience for me to learn how to be more open.
