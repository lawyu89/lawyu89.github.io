        <h1>My Thinking Style: Understanding and Learning</h1>
        <h2>How I Tend to Learn and How I Plan to Improve!</h2>
        <h4>2/1/15</h4>
        <section>
          <p class="bodytext">Prior to starting Dev Bootcamp phase-0, we took a <a href=http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html> quiz</a> to determine our <a href=” http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm”> Gregorc Thinking Style</a>.  There are four main thinking styles that Anthony Gregroc listed: Concrete Sequential (CS), Abstract Random (AR), Abstract Sequential (AS), and Concrete Random (CR). In the article, there is a table that list how each thinking styles learns best. The article also describes some behavior aspects about each thinking style like their likes and dislikes. From the quiz, I discovered I had an abstract sequential thinking style. Abstract sequential thinkers thrive when they have access to experts and references for them to learn from.  They also tend to work best when they are by themselves and in environments that help them think. I felt like the article was pretty accurate in how I behave (my learning likes and dislikes) and how I like to learn.  </p>

          <p class="bodytext">Know that I have an abstract sequential thinking style, I plan to maximize my learning experience at DBC by taking full advantage of the resources they provide in terms of asking instructors for help, going to office hours when I have specific questions, or reading the different papers and websites they give to learn more about coding concepts. So far my biggest struggle at DBC would probably be motivating myself to work diligently whenever I am working at home. I tend to work better in the presence of others in an environmental that is stimulating.  Thankfully, there are some people from my cohort who likes to meet up in person where we can all work on the material together.  When the onsite phase-1 comes around, I will most likely spend a lot of time on campus since I believe I will work most efficiently there. </p>

          <p class="bodytext">While I think that it is important for one to learn in ways that are best suit to one’s thinking-style, we should also be as open as possible and try to learn in different ways too. Having a fixed mindset and always repeating the things we know can cause us to plateau in how much information we can gain through our learning experiences.  Instead having a growth mindset, where we are open to try new things and aren’t afraid to fail will allow us to learn much more.  I feel that my current self is more of a fixed mindset than a growth mindset, but over the course of DBC I will do my very best to be open to trying new things and develop a growth mindset. </p>

          <p>Thanks for reading!</span></p>
