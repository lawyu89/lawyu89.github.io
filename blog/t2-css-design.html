        This week of Phase 0, we went over basic HTML and CSS foundamentals. For this week's blog entry, I'll be quickly covering CSS positioning with margins, borders, and padding.

        Whenever an element is created in HTML like div's or p's, that element will take up some space on your page. That space that the element takes up can be shifted around however you like by tweeking some of its properties.

        If you wanted to visualize the space an element, you can simply set a border. Adding a border will do exactly what it sounds like it will do, create lines around an object. With css, you can change the thickness, color, and line-style.

        Margins allows us to move an element relative to other elements or "walls" of a HTML document. You can think of margins like adding whitespace around your border. Margins extends outwards from the borders of an element and you can add it to any direction you like (top,left,bottom, and right).

        Lastly, padding is the space between your border and actual content. You can similarily adjust the direction and extension length like you can with margins! Review the diagram below for assistance vizualizing margins, borders, and padding. See you next time!
